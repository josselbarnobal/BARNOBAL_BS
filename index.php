	Banking is the heart and soul of every economy, and it is one sector that will never go out of style.<br> While the global economy may be going through turmoil, the banking sector in India is a highly competitive and rapidly growing space.<br> The Indian banking space is divided between state banks, private owned banks and co-operative banks. <br>With more than half of Indiaâ€™s population still under the age of 30, the demand for the simplest banking products like savings accounts, credit cards and loans rises at an exceptional rate each year and should continue to do so for the next 20 years.<br><br>

	While Technology has done its bit to ensure that cash availability and access has become a lot easier through the ever increasing number of ATMs, there is still a need for other financial products to be made available to the masses.<br> Branches are coming up by the dozen in smaller cities and towns across the country and there will always be a demand for quality personnel to meet this growth.<br><br>

	Reports indicate that the Indian banking space has witnessed an 18% growth over the last decade, with the last 5-years exhibiting growth rates just under 25%.<br> The industry size is believed to be closing in on $1.5 trillion and Indian banking will in all likelihood cross the $5 trillion mark within the next 5 years.<br><br>

	If there was ever a good time to be joining the banking space, it is now.<br>

<h2>Safe in the temple: 18th century BC</h2>

Wealth compressed into the convenient form of gold brings one disadvantage. <br />
Unless well hidden or protected, it is easily stolen.

In early civilizations a temple is considered the safest refuge; it is a solid building, <br />
constantly attended, with a sacred character which itself may deter thieves.<br /> 
In Egypt and Mesopotamia gold is deposited in temples for safe-keeping. <br />
But it lies idle there, while others in the trading community or in government have desperate need of it. <br />
In Babylon at the time of Hammurabi, in the 18th century BC, there are records of loans made by the priests of the temple.<br />
The concept of banking has arrived.<br /><br />

<h2>Greek and Roman financiers: from the 4th century BC</h2>

Banking activities in Greece are more varied and sophisticated than in any previous society. <br />
Private entrepreneurs, as well as temples and public bodies, now undertake financial transactions. <br />
They take deposits, make loans, change money from one currency to another and test coins for weight and purity.<br />

They even engage in book transactions. <br />
Moneylenders can be found who will accept payment in one Greek city and arrange for credit in another,<br />
 avoiding the need for the customer to transport or transfer large numbers of coins.<br /><br />
	  	


Rome, with its genius for administration, adopts and regularizes the banking practices of Greece.<br /> 
By the 2nd century AD a debt can officially be discharged by paying the appropriate sum into a bank,<br /> 
and public notaries are appointed to register such transactions.

The collapse of trade after the fall of the Roman empire makes bankers less necessary than before, <br />
and their demise is hastened by the hostility of the Christian church to the charging of interest.<br /> 
Usury comes to seem morally offensive. One anonymous medieval author declares vividly that 'a usurer <br />
is a bawd to his own money bags, taking a fee that they may engender together'.
